# Implementation Plan - Brand Image & Projects Refresh

Refined brand imagery and content for DATA.BUILD following the "Nano Banana" style and luxury fashion focus.

## 1. Brand Style Definition (North Star)
- **Concept**: Architectural Minimalism & Ethereal Light.
- **Style Keywords**: Minimalist, architectural, play of light and shadow, luxury fashion retail, concrete, glass, high-contrast, ethereal, precise, premium.
- **Prompting Strategy (Nano Banana)**: Use descriptive, sensory-focused prompts that emphasize materials (concrete, silk, glass), lighting (raking light, soft shadows), and composition (geometric, centered, airy).

## 2. Image Generation
- **Landing Page Image**: A high-end fashion retail space or a conceptual architectural detail representing "Luxury Fashion".
- **Project Images**:
  - Project 01 (Luxury Fashion eCommerce - STYLEBOP): High-end studio or showroom detail.
  - Project 02 (Lifestyle eCommerce - Blume2000): Minimalist botanical architectural detail.
  - Project 03 (Campaign Logic - Zalando): Geometric pattern representing "Logic" in a fashion context (e.g., repeating textile patterns or architectural grids).
  - Project 04 (Platform Strategy - Intersport/Retail): Decentralized architectural space or glass-centric office structure.
  - Project 05 (Omnichannel - Calida): Soft fabric textures integrated with hard architectural lines.

## 3. UI Updates
- **Projects Page**:
  - Add the quote: "Data is the invisible thread that holds the luxury experience together. We weave complexity into clarity."
  - Update `PROJECTS` constant with new image paths.
- **Landing Page**:
  - Update hero background image.

## 4. Content Refinement
- Ensure project descriptions in `constants.ts` align with the insights from `assets/projects.csv` while maintaining a premium tone.

## 5. Verification
- Verify image quality and alignment with the "North Star" style.
- Check quote placement and styling on the Projects page.
