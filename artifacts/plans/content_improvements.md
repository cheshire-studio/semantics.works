## 8. FAQ PAGE

### Current Problem

Common objections aren't addressed. Buyers leave with unanswered questions.

### Required FAQs

**Q: Why hire a consultancy instead of building an in-house team?**  
A: Speed and expertise. We've built 50+ data platforms. Your first hire will be learning on your dime. We deliver production-ready architecture in weeks, then train your team to maintain it.

**Q: Do you only work with large enterprises?**  
A: No. Our sweet spot is agile SMEs (€10M-€500M revenue) and high-growth eCommerce. We specialize in "right-sized" architecture—not over-engineered, not under-built.

**Q: What if we're already using Snowflake/Databricks instead of BigQuery?**  
A: We're platform-agnostic for semantic layer work. However, our deepest expertise is in BigQuery/GCP. If you're committed to another platform, we can recommend specialists.

**Q: How do you ensure knowledge transfer?**  
A: Every engagement includes documentation, training sessions, and optional "office hours" post-delivery. We don't create dependencies—we build capabilities.

**Q: What's your typical engagement length?**  
A: 8-16 weeks for most projects. Discovery workshops are 1 week. Retainers are month-to-month with 30-day notice.

**Q: Do you sign NDAs?**  
A: Yes, always. We also offer mutual NDAs for IP-sensitive work.
